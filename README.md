NASA API Web App

## Dependencies:
Before you run the `start_app.ps1` install your dependencies first. Install yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/ 

> A quick explanation of what is yarn: Yarn is a package manager that most Node.js developers use. It contains useful commands to integrate their package with their respective config files.

Do `pip install flask python-dotenv` and wait for the process to install.

## Now to initialize
I have made a simple script to start the web app. 

#### Note
Make sure that you are in your Python Virtual Environment.
Do `npm install` inside the project directory.
Now type, `./start_app.ps1` and wait for your web app to initialize.
You will have a minimized PowerShell prompt that you can use to retrieve information and stop the web app.

## Finish
To stop, go to the powershell prompts and press `Ctrl + C` to each of them.
